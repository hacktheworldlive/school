For the SQl database:





The following is what this SQL dump for a tournament database does:

The following tables are produced by it:

events -Keeps track of event information such as event name and type (team or individual).
matchups: Holds matchup data, such as the name of the event, the winner, the round number, the outcome (win, draw, or defeat), and the status (completed or pending).
Participants: Keeps track of participant information, such as name, type, and points.
scores: Keeps track of each competitor's scores for every event round.
Teams: Holds information on a team, such as its name, members, and points.

Additionally, it establishes auto-increment for id fields so that they automatically grow with each new entry and specifies primary keys for every table.

To guarantee correct data encoding and time zone management, it also manages character sets and timezone settings. These modifications become permanent in the database when the transaction is finally committed.
